Certain interactions with this site may lead to processing of personal data. This page is designed to give an overview of how and when any personal data is processed.

## Analytics

This site uses a self-hosted alternative to _Google Analytics_ called [umami](https://umami.is/).

> Umami does not collect any personal information, does not use cookies, does not track users across websites, and is GDPR compliant. [...] All data collected is anonymized, making it impossible to identify any individual user.

## Leaving a comment

~~This site uses a self-hosted alternative to _Disqus_ called [Isso](https://isso-comments.de/).~~

~~When you choose to write a comment, you are **not required to enter any personal information**. You can at **any time request the removal** of one or all comments associated with your personal data.~~

Ever since moving to **Eleventy** and creating a new theme ([read about it](/blog/2023/10/migrating-from-hugo-to-eleventy-11ty/)) I decided to remove comments. Over a period of nearly two years I didn't receive a single comment, so why bother.
