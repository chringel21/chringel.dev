## Here we go (again)

Hello everyone, and welcome to my *new* blog. This is a fresh start for me, after I dumped my first two blogs. I’ll be writing about everything from *FOSS*, to notes from *development hell* and *gaming* and *social media*. I hope to get in the groove of writing on a regular basis, but we’ll see about that :)

I nearly missed the start of 2022. This is kind of a New Year's resolution for me, the write every couple of weeks, get my thoughts straight, put something together that I look back to.

There are already some plans in my mind, that I hope I can bring to an end.
