## Hi, I'm Christian 👋

A **software engineer** from Potsdam, Germany. That's just outside of Berlin. Not as big, but also not as busy.

[Blogging](/blog/) about my experiences, to **help others**, and to keep track of what I've done.

Lifelong learner and **open-source enthusiast**, mainly working on web based **spatial applications**.

Also a [hobby photographer](https://pixelfed.de/i/web/profile/382484911250793335).

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/chringel21), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeEgge) or [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@chringel).

If you enjoyed some of the stuff I wrote, you can [**buy me a coffee** ☕️](https://ko-fi.com/chringel), I'd really appreciate it! Thanks!🙏
