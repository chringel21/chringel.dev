I had a pretty wild debugging ride when implementing [go-jamming](https://git.brainbaking.com/wgroeneveld/go-jamming) üòµ‚Äçüí´.

Problem: go-jamming wasn't sending webmentions.

There were two root causes to this problem, one on my side, and one on go-jamming's side.

go-jamming checks the site's RSS feed where to send webmentions. It [expects the raw HTML in the post item's description tag](https://git.brainbaking.com/wgroeneveld/go-jamming/src/branch/master/app/webmention/send/rsslinkcollector.go#L52). But Hugo, by default, puts a [summary of a post](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/_default/rss.xml#L35) in there. I could fix that by adapting my theme.

When that was fixed, go-jamming only found inbound URLs to my site. Turns out, the way my theme implemented link rendering would add a bunch of newlines (prettier, why would you do this to me?), that the [regex](https://git.brainbaking.com/wgroeneveld/go-jamming/src/branch/master/app/webmention/send/rsslinkcollector.go#L59) wasn't capturing. I could fix that in my theme as well.

At least I now know how to debug a go project üëç.
