description: I finally have time to listen to podcasts again. Here are some recommendations.
---

I was a passionate podcast listener when I used to commute to work, but Covid changed that (what did Covid not change, I'm asking?). Not going to the office meant no time on the train, meant no time for podcasts.

Now that I'm on parental leave, I finally have time to listen to some podcasts again. Every time I'm strolling around outside and my son is having a snooze, I'll pop those pods in. I did abandon all the old stuff I used to listen to and picked some new shows. Here are some recommendations.

## For professional development

[Syntax.](https://syntax.fm/) is a podcast about web development. Listening to it is a great way to stay up to date with the latest stuff that's going with JavaScript, CSS, Node, React, PHP... you get the gist. It is hosted by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) and [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski), and they make up a great couple to listen to. They also have some great guests, web development experts, on their show on a regular basis.

## For social skills

This one's in German, sorry! [Working Dad Podcast](https://workingdad.podigee.io/) has some great episodes on the day-to-day life of, well, _working dads_. I picked this show, because recently I was more and more engaged with topics like the image of a modern father, care work and reconciliation of family and working life. No matter how daring the topic, this podcast probably already covered it in one of its episodes.

## For the laughs

Sorry, again in German (I'm from Germany, so what can I do?). [Extra 3](https://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/extra_3/video-podcast/index.html) is a weekly, satirical review of politics, economics and just the usual craziness of German law ("Der Irrsinn der Woche"). Although it's just the audio of the actual TV show, it's just as good and makes me laugh!
