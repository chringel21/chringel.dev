title: Creating a Google Maps Clone
---

This is a multipart series on how to create a **full stack Google Maps Clone**. It covers every step in the process: How to create **vector tiles** from OpenStreetMap data, serving them using a **tile server**, setting up a simple **geocoder** for searching places and street names, implementing a **routing API** und finally, building a **frontend GUI** to wire everything together. This Google Maps Clone will cover only a small spatial extent. Building the whole world is beyond the scope of this implementation.
