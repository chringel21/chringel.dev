Time flies.

It always has and always will. That is especially true in your thirties. They are like the **express highway of life**, with so much going on: career, marriage, kids growing up, parents getting older. School, college, university all seemed to last for an eternity. But now, blink, and you are going miss something.

I turned thirty-five recently, and I'm about to have my second kid. I work full-time at a medium-sized software development and consulting company, specialized on web based spatial applications using open source software and open data. My day-to-day work consists of doing backend stuff with Kotlin and PHP and frontend using React. **And I'm worried I won't find more time to skill up**, or keep up with the latest developments in IT.

Is that an irrational fear? Maybe, but maybe not. Please don't get me wrong: My job is great, as are the working conditions. Getting time for parental leave was no problem at all, and it won't be the second time around. Working part-time is also possible.

But what about professional development, trying out new frameworks, maybe even a new programming language? How do I find time for that, when **I also really want to spend time with my kids**. Is that even necessary, after more than five years of professional work in the industry, and ten more years of experience gained through small personal projects?

[Recently I asked on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@chringel/108888001998927255) how other parents working as developers skill up. I was encouraged to not being "afraid of just install[ing] and us[ing] new things" ([@nurettin@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/web/@nurettin/108890384760849674)). **Creating small projects** and finishing them, even if it's just a _Hello World_, will keep motivation high. Abandoned projects that were too ambitious will linger on in the back of your head. Marco Bresciani on the other hand "play[s] a lot of Lego with [his] kid" ([@AAMfP@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/web/@AAMfP/108891284160115123)), which is also absolutely legit and something I would also like to achieve.

Perhaps I shouldn't be as worried at all as I currently am. In many ways, **the developer in me can benefit from being a parent and vice versa**. [Gilad Shoham](https://twitter.com/ShohamGilad) has written a [very personal report](https://hackernoon.com/how-being-a-dad-makes-me-a-better-developer-and-vice-versa-85a92884eeaf) on how it will boost your "creativity, persistency, responsibility, teamwork [and] logical thinking [...]". It still holds up, even after almost four years, and I agree with most of it. I would also add management skills to the list.

Writing this post and thinking about my personal aims as a developer brought me to the conclusion that **there is nothing wrong with missing out on "nerdy things"**. What really matters is to prioritize the right things. Stop worrying about dedicated learning time, because you'll increase your skills on the go, while you are working. Parenting is a job as well, and you won't learn it in your spare time.

Time flies. And while you're reading this, another five minutes have passed. Did you blink?
